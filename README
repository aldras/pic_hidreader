ASM file revision 1.0c 2011-06-18

This is an assembly program for a PIC16F77 that is connected to a HID 125Khz card reader.  The purpose of this project is to read an HID card and compare it to a list in memory, if it matches a card in memory a relay is activated to perform an action such as opening a door.

There are several things that have not been implemented in this, but provides a base for someone who would like a starting point.

One big issue is with RF interference, the project has not been hardened aghinst RF interference and being close to a transmitting antenna, especially around 146Mhz, can cause issues with the microcontroller.

The other not implemented feature is the ability to edit stored cards.

Connecting the microcontroller through RS232, or through a RS232 USB adapter, will allow the ability to add new cards, delete cards, and see what cards are scanned as they are being scanned.  The RS232 settings are 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity.  Refer to the ASM file for details on where to connect this, it is specified.  I will also need to upload a schematic at a later time to show how things are connected.

At present the following major components are used:
Microchip PIC16F77 microcontroller
Microchop 24LC64 64kbit (8kbyte) SPI EEPROM memory chip
MAX232 RS232 level shifter for RS232 interface
7417 buffer for input/output for protection of the microcontroller I/O
4Mhz crystal for the microcontroller

The microcontroller connections are shown in the included asm file, but I intend to upload a full schematic soon.
